The buy method first checks to see if the shares entered is in integer form and if there are sufficient funds to make the purchase. If the company is contained within the stocks of the account, the program executes a buy and purchases the stock. The sell method also checks to see if the shares entered is in integer form and if there are enough stocks to sell. If both conditions are met, the program sells the stock. Refresh prices uses a for loop to reset the prices of each stock. Get Portfolio returns a list of stocks that are currently owned. Get Balance returns the total balance, defined as cash amount plus value of the stocks. Print Portfolio prints a list of all stocks currently in the portfolio. Print History prints a history of all transactions."
